Lagrangian density is not envolved in punctual  treatment.
May be it connected with field propagation  and the conservation princiles.(Energy, motion quantities etc...)
But relativistic general principles say that this variables are invilved togheter..
We are trating a somekind different of this.precisely  separated entities that tohg treats all in a differend kind of way.
